# 🎉 Cortex RBAC Tool - Enhancement Summary

## What Was Done

Your Streamlit app for checking Snowflake role permissions for Cortex Analyst has been **completely overhauled and enhanced**!

---

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Data Structure Bug** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: App crashed when trying to filter grants  
**Cause**: Code treated Snowpark Row list as pandas DataFrame  
**Fixed**: Now properly converts to DataFrame immediately  

### 2. **Dictionary Access Error** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Runtime error in `check_cortex_access()`  
**Cause**: Using `.get()` on a list instead of DataFrame  
**Fixed**: Proper pandas column access with null handling  

### 3. **Inconsistent Data Types** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Functions returned mixed types  
**Fixed**: All functions now return consistent pandas DataFrames
