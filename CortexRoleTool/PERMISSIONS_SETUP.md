# Permissions Setup Guide

## üîê Required Permissions for the App Owner Role

The Cortex RBAC Tool needs specific permissions to query role grants in Snowflake. This guide will help you set up the correct permissions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Error: Cannot Query ACCOUNT_USAGE

### Error Message You See:
```
‚ùå Failed to query ACCOUNT_USAGE views for [ROLE_NAME]
SQL compilation error: error line 4 at position 16 invalid identifier 'GRANTED_ROLE'
```

### Root Cause:
The app owner role lacks permissions to query `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.GRANTS_TO_ROLES`.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Grant Necessary Permissions

### Option 1: Grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES (Recommended)

This is the **recommended approach** as it provides read-only access to the SNOWFLAKE database.

```sql
-- Run as ACCOUNTADMIN or a role with MANAGE GRANTS privilege

-- 1. Identify your app owner role (the role that owns the Streamlit app)
-- Usually this is the role you used when creating the Streamlit app

-- 2. Grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on SNOWFLAKE database
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <YOUR_APP_OWNER_ROLE>;

-- Example:
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;
```

**What this grants:**
- ‚úÖ Read access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` views
- ‚úÖ Read access to `SNOWFLAKE.INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views
- ‚úÖ No write or modification permissions
- ‚úÖ Minimal security risk

---

### Option 2: Grant MANAGE GRANTS (More Permissive)

This grants broader permissions and should only be used if Option 1 doesn't work.

```sql
-- Run as ACCOUNTADMIN

GRANT MANAGE GRANTS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE <YOUR_APP_OWNER_ROLE>;

-- Example:
GRANT MANAGE GRANTS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;
```

**What this grants:**
- ‚úÖ Ability to view all grants in the account
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ability to grant and revoke privileges (use with caution)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher security risk

## üéØ Complete Setup Script

Here's a complete script to set up a dedicated role for the Cortex RBAC Tool:

```sql
-- ============================================================================
-- Cortex RBAC Tool - Complete Setup Script
-- Run as ACCOUNTADMIN
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. Create a dedicated role for the app owner
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS CORTEX_ADMIN
    COMMENT = 'Role for Cortex RBAC Tool app owner';

-- 2. Grant access to SNOWFLAKE database (for querying ACCOUNT_USAGE)
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;

-- 3. Create database and schema for the app
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CORTEX_TOOLS
    COMMENT = 'Database for Cortex administration tools';

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CORTEX_TOOLS.APPS
    COMMENT = 'Schema for Streamlit apps';

-- 4. Grant permissions on the app database
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE CORTEX_TOOLS TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA CORTEX_TOOLS.APPS TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;

-- 5. Grant warehouse usage (needed to run queries)
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;
-- Adjust warehouse name as needed

-- 6. Grant the role to your user
GRANT ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN TO USER <YOUR_USERNAME>;
-- Replace <YOUR_USERNAME> with your actual username

-- 7. Verify the grants
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;

-- ============================================================================
-- Verification Query
-- ============================================================================

-- Test if you can query ACCOUNT_USAGE
USE ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS role_count 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROLES 
WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL;

-- If this returns a number, you're all set!
-- If it errors, you may need ACCOUNTADMIN to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES
```

---

## üîç Verify Your Setup

### Step 1: Check Current Role Grants

```sql
-- See what privileges your app owner role has
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE <YOUR_APP_OWNER_ROLE>;
```

Look for one of these in the output:
- `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES | SNOWFLAKE | DATABASE`
- `MANAGE GRANTS | ACCOUNT`

### Step 2: Test ACCOUNT_USAGE Access

```sql
-- Switch to your app owner role
USE ROLE <YOUR_APP_OWNER_ROLE>;

-- Try to query ACCOUNT_USAGE
SELECT NAME 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROLES 
WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL 
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected Result:** List of roles  
**If Error:** You need to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES (see Option 1 above)

### Step 3: Test Grants Query

```sql
-- Test the exact query the app uses
USE ROLE <YOUR_APP_OWNER_ROLE>;

SELECT 
    GRANTED_ON,
    PRIVILEGE,
    CASE WHEN GRANTED_ON = 'ROLE' THEN NAME ELSE NULL END AS GRANTED_ROLE,
    NAME AS OBJECT_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.GRANTS_TO_ROLES
WHERE GRANTEE_NAME = 'PUBLIC'  -- Test with PUBLIC role
  AND DELETED_ON IS NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected Result:** List of grants  
**If Error:** Check the error message and grant appropriate permissions

## üö® Troubleshooting Specific Errors

### Error: "SQL compilation error: invalid identifier 'GRANTED_ROLE'"

**Cause:** Query syntax error or insufficient permissions

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <APP_OWNER_ROLE>;
```

### Error: "Stored procedure execution error: Unsupported statement type 'SHOW GRANT'"

**Cause:** SHOW GRANTS is not supported in Streamlit in Snowflake

**Fix:** This is expected! The app will automatically fall back to INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries. However, you still need to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES for full functionality.

### Error: "Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed"

**Cause:** Role doesn't have access to SNOWFLAKE database

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Grant access to SNOWFLAKE database
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <APP_OWNER_ROLE>;
```

### Error: "Insufficient privileges to operate on database 'SNOWFLAKE'"

**Cause:** You're not running as ACCOUNTADMIN or a role with sufficient privileges

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Switch to ACCOUNTADMIN first
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Then grant the privileges
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <APP_OWNER_ROLE>;
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Use a Dedicated Role
‚úÖ **DO:** Create a specific role for the app (e.g., `CORTEX_ADMIN`)  
‚ùå **DON'T:** Use `ACCOUNTADMIN` as the app owner

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
‚úÖ **DO:** Grant only `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` on SNOWFLAKE database  
‚ùå **DON'T:** Grant `MANAGE GRANTS` unless absolutely necessary

### 3. Document the Role
```sql
-- Add a comment explaining the role's purpose
COMMENT ON ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN IS 
'App owner role for Cortex RBAC Tool. Has read-only access to ACCOUNT_USAGE for querying role grants.';
```

### 4. Regular Audits
```sql
-- Periodically review what privileges the role has
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;

-- Check who has this role
SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE CORTEX_ADMIN;
```

### 5. Limit Role Assignment
‚úÖ **DO:** Grant the app owner role only to necessary users  
‚ùå **DON'T:** Grant it to PUBLIC or broad user groups

---

## üìã Checklist

Before deploying the Cortex RBAC Tool, verify:

- [ ] Created a dedicated app owner role (e.g., `CORTEX_ADMIN`)
- [ ] Granted `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE` to the role
- [ ] Created database and schema for the app
- [ ] Granted warehouse USAGE to the role
- [ ] Granted the role to your user
- [ ] Tested ACCOUNT_USAGE access with the role
- [ ] Tested the grants query with the role
- [ ] Documented the role's purpose
- [ ] Limited role assignment to necessary users

---

## üéì Understanding ACCOUNT_USAGE vs INFORMATION_SCHEMA

### ACCOUNT_USAGE (Preferred)
- **Scope:** Account-wide visibility
- **Data:** Comprehensive historical data
- **Latency:** Up to 2 hours delay
- **Access:** Requires `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE`
- **Use Case:** Full grant analysis, all roles

### INFORMATION_SCHEMA (Fallback)
- **Scope:** Current database/schema only
- **Data:** Real-time but limited
- **Latency:** None (real-time)
- **Access:** Based on current role's privileges
- **Use Case:** Limited grant visibility

**The app uses ACCOUNT_USAGE by default** for comprehensive results, with INFORMATION_SCHEMA as a fallback.

---

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you've followed this guide and still encounter errors:

1. **Verify you're running as ACCOUNTADMIN** when granting privileges
2. **Check the exact role name** used by your Streamlit app
3. **Review Snowflake query history** for detailed error messages
4. **Test queries manually** using the verification steps above
5. **Check Snowflake documentation** for any account-specific restrictions

### Useful Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Who am I?
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE(), CURRENT_USER();

-- What can my current role do?
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE IDENTIFIER(CURRENT_ROLE());

-- Can I access ACCOUNT_USAGE?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROLES WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL;

-- What roles exist in my account?
SELECT NAME FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROLES WHERE DELETED_ON IS NULL ORDER BY NAME;
```
